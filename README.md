# Welcome to My Portfolio
Hello! I'm Juan, a Software Engineer

### Project 1
- **Description**: Idea I applied into an inside project at my current company, where I use [this article](https://laravel-news.com/working-with-third-party-services-in-laravel) as a source of inspiration, with a few tweaks of my own so I didn't have to create a file per resource I just reversed the dependencies.
- **Technologies**: PHP
- **Link**: [GitHub Repository](#)

## About Me

I am passionate and versatile software engineer with a rich multicultural background and a dedication to delivering impactful, high-quality solutions.

Originally from Venezuela, I moved to Portugal at 17, where I completed my degree in SE. Shortly after, I accepted an offer from the company where I had interned, marking the start of my professional journey. After a year and a half, I transitioned to my current role, working remotely for a Swiss company, where I've been part of the team for over a year.

Throughout my career, I’ve developed a strong technical foundation and a reputation as a **hard-working, adaptable team member**. My work spans a range of responsibilities—from integrating complex systems and handling back-end development to assisting in design and system administration.
